# Change-taxa-names
R-scripts to change taxa names in Fasta or tree (NEWICK) files. 

The script "replace.R" is called by a file type-specific R script (for NEWICK tree or FASTA sequence file types). 

Example files for FASTA file name change are included:
names.csv
alignment.fasta
(output = newname_alignment.fasta)

The function change.taxa.names was created by Sebastian Duchene.
